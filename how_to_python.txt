iMake sure that the github repository has a ".gitignore", you can check this by running:
- find . -name ".gitignore"
- If nothing comes up, run this command:
	- touch .gitignore && echo "venv/" >> .gitignore

Make a virtual environment

- virtualenv -p `which python3` venv

Activate virtual environment

- source venv/bin/activate

Install

- pip install <package name>
	* numpy

Save the packages

- pip freeze > requirements.txt

----------------------------------

Picking up where you left off

- cd <directory_of_venv>, this is the directory you were working in before
- ls -al, you should see venv pop up

Activate virtual environment

- source venv/bin/activate

If not found, do this:

++	Make a virtual environment 
++	- virtualenv -p `which python3` venv
This will get you back up and running....

Sometimes, you need to get the packages again

- pip install -r requirements.txt

You only need to do this if you had to re-make the virtual environment
